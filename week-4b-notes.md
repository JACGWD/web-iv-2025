# Week 4b Class Notes

Today is mostly a lab day, however please review these pages:

- [CSS Basics](https://github.com/JACGWD/css-layout/blob/main/css-basics.md)
- [Mobile First](https://github.com/JACGWD/css-layout/blob/main/mobile-first.md)
- [Flexbox](https://github.com/JACGWD/css-layout/blob/main/flexbox.md)
  
Also note that an image editor VS Code extension has been added to the [recommended VS Code extensions repo](https://github.com/JACGWD/VS-Code-Extensions-List/blob/main/vs-code-extensions-list.txt). Look for **tyriar.luna-paint**, a "Photoshop Lite" to edit images directly inside VS Code.
