# Vocabulary

## Domain name	

The name of a web site, such as “acme.com” and “graphicandwebdesign.ca”. These must be unique for people to be able to find you on the internet. For example, there cannot be two acme.coms.
To prevent duplicates, there is a world-wide index of domain names. See DNS.

### Tip

When reserving a domain name for your client, always reserve similar names/same name with different TLDs so that your client's competition do not purchase these names and redirect users looking for your client to their own web sites instead. For example, if your client wants acme.com you can also buy acme.ca, acme.org, and acme.net.


## DNS	Domain Name Server system

A series of servers that have the definitive list of domain names available on the internet. The **internet’s telephone book** of sorts listing domain names and their corresponding IP addresses.

For example: johnabbott.qc.ca = 35.206.100.46

## WHOIS	

The built-in DNS search tool. Can be run from a terminal window, or from many different web sites like whois.net


## TLD	

“Top Level Domain” are the suffixes added to the domain name, such as .com or .ca. See: [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Internet_top-level_domains](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Internet_top-level_domains)

## IP Address	

Computers don’t use words to identify each other, they use numbers. Network locations are referred to by Internet Protocol (“IP”) Addresses.

Using IP version 4 they look like this: 127.0.0.1 (always your computer’s “self” address, same as the word “localhost”) or something like 204.256.128.168.

Since the internet has started running out of IP 4 addresses, there is an **IP version 6** where addresses look like this: 2001:0db8:0000:0000:0000:ff00:0042:8329


## Registrar	

A company whose service is selling and managing domain names.

.CA	To reserve a .ca domain name, you must use a registrar based in Canada.
(Your hosting however can be anywhere.)

### Note 1
It is safer to manage your domain name with a Registrar different from your hosting company. It can get complicated to move your hosting and domain away from a company that you are having problems with.

### Note 2 [Very Important]

Always pay extra for **domain name privacy**. The WHOIS database can be viewed by anyone on the internet. It has your name, address, phone number, email, etc. It is a great place to start stealing someone's identity. Always keep that information private.

## Host	

A company that maintains web servers, and rents space on them.

Basically a warehouse full of Apache/MySQL machines with thousands or millions of virtual htdocs folders for rent.


## Hosting account

A paid account where you get your own htdocs folder, linked to your domain name. Comes with email, FTP, PHPMyAdmin and a control panel.

Hosting accounts often come with the domain name for free.

#### Tip: If something were to go wrong with your host it is better to have your domain name with an independent registrar. If both your hosting and domain name go down because they are with the same company there’s not much you can do.

### Note

The thing you need to look for in a good host is not just a good price. **The most important criteria is good technical support.** You need a host that can reliably and quickly help you solve problems. They only way to find this out is by doing your own research. Go to Facebook or Reddit or some other designer community and see what people recommend. Ask questions. What are the good companies? What are the bad ones?
