## GitHub Desktop

GitHub Desktop is a visual interface to [Git](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Git), which is a version control software, and the code repositories (aka project folders) are hosted on the [GitHub web site](https://www.github.com). GitHub is now owned by Microsoft.

If you work in web design, you can easily work remotely—such as being a [digital nomad](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digital_nomad)—and collaborate with team members worldwide using Git, GitHub, GitLab... there are several sites that offers the same thing. All the Microsoft-haters left GitHub when it was bought out.

I will be using **GitHub Desktop** to share class notes and code. It is already installed in the GWD labs. Please install it on your home machine to always have access to the latest information.

## Comprehensive Assessments

On Omnivox, I have shared a 2048px X 2048px Photoshop document to help everyone standardize their image sizes. This will help your portfolios look more professional by eliminating variations in width and height from page to page in the portfolio.

### Note

If you have an image that is particularly tall, like the email newsletter, you can match the width but keep a proportional height taller than 2048px. In other words, you can match only one dimension in order to maintain visual consistency between pages when matching two dimensions causes layout problems.
