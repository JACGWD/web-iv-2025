# Week 9 Class Notes

## Evaluation of Montreal Real Estate Pages 

Go to the Excel spreadsheet for the assignment. There is a new tab called "Corrections".

By default, the grade is 9/10 for a page being reformatted using proper HTML blocks. Change the garde, or add/deduct points according to these criteria:

1. All the text content is inside a shortcode block: 0/10
2. All the text content is nothing but paragraph tags: 0/10
3. H1 tag(s) on the page: 5/10
4. Are there any "fake lists" (paragraphs that start with a manually entered digit or dash/bullet) on the page: 5/10
5. Are there any "fake headers" (paragraphs that are manually made bigger and bold) on the page: 5/10
6. Are there any stray/random characters on the page (ex: > at the very end): 7/10
7. The page is empty: 
   1. No "Empty" comment in Excel: 0/10
   2. "Empty" comment in Excel: 7/10
8. "By Jennifer Walker" paragraph -> assign "byline" as a class: yes: +1 | no: -1
9. If there is any actual HTML code (ex: a div), is it in a "Custom HTML" block: yes: +1 | no: -1
